### Ka-Ching Cash Register (v1)

> Ka-Ching is a decentralized point-of-sale (PoS) system, essentially a blockchain-based digital checkout counter that enables transactions without any central authority. Its key feature is the use of off-chain signed orders, which blend the safety and transparency of on-chain transactions with the effectiveness of off-chain processes. The system validates orders for authorized signers, expiry, and usage to prevent fraud and double-spending.
